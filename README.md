Fake News Headline Classifier (NLP)
Designed an NLP classification model that discriminates between real and fake news headlines by utilizing the fake-news Kaggle dataset and simple machine learning. This project loaded and merged Fake.csv and True.csv, extracted only the headline/title field of the datasets, and conducted some text preprocessing by lowercasing, removing punctuation and non-alphabet characters, and filtering with English stopwords. Further, cleaned text was then converted into numerical features with TF-IDF vectorization before splitting into a training and testing set to train and test a Logistic Regression classifier. Model performance was assessed on a held-out test set using accuracy, reaching approximately 90% or more depending on the preprocessing and random state set in the code, and visualized as a confusion matrix heatmap with indications of correct and incorrect predictions. The proposed solution has been implemented end-to-end in Python using the popular pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. The entire code was placed into a well-documented Jupyter/Google Colab notebook in which every step was clearly explained.
